# LNDKrub

Rewritten wrapper for Lightning Network Daemon in TypeScript based on [LNDHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub).
This is a tribute to the amazing work done by [BlueWallet Team](https://github.com/BlueWallet) with
some creative differences, as followed:

- TypeScript helps the project scale in the long-term.
- Scrap monolithic structure for an easier to track modular one.
- Dependency injection pattern for loose coupling.
- Vite for front-end construction.
- Vitest for API testing and BlueWallet compatibility maintenance.
- Paired with crontab for script-running.
- Pending integration with Chaumian e-cash, [cashu-ts](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu-ts)
- Pending integration with Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays, [nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools)
